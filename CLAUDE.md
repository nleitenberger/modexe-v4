## Project Architecture

**Modexe** is a React Native journalism app built with Expo that combines visual storytelling with social sharing. The app has two primary features: a responsive journal editor and a customizable profile system called "ModSpace".

### Core Concept
- **Journal**: Two-page spread format with drag-and-drop stickers and intelligent text wrapping
- **ModSpace**: Personal profile hub for sharing journal entries with customizable layouts and themes
- **Responsive Design**: Single page in portrait mode, dual-page spread in landscape mode

### State Management - Redux Toolkit

The app uses a centralized Redux store with three main slices:

**`src/store/index.ts`** - Main store configuration with serialization handling for Date objects and complex data structures.

**`src/store/journalSlice.ts`** - Journal management:
- `currentJournal`: Active journal with pages, content, and stickers
- `currentSpreadIndex`: Landscape mode pagination (dual-page spreads)
- `currentPageIndex`: Portrait mode pagination (single pages)
- Actions: `createJournal`, `updatePageContent`, `addSticker`, `updateSticker`, `setCurrentSpread`, `setCurrentPage`, `nextPage`, `prevPage`

**`src/store/stickerSlice.ts`** - Sticker system:
- `availableStickers`: Sticker categories and items
- `placedStickers`: Stickers placed on pages  
- `selectedSticker`: Currently selected sticker for editing
- Drag-and-drop state management with position, scale, rotation, z-index

**`src/store/modspaceSlice.ts`** - Profile system:
- `currentModSpace`: User's profile data and customization
- `sharedContent`: Shared journal entries and media
- Layout templates, themes, privacy settings, social links

### Navigation Architecture

**Stack + Tab Navigation** (`src/components/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`):
- **ModSpace**: Primary tab - personal profile and content hub (default screen)
- **Discover**: Future social discovery features
- **Settings**: App configuration (placeholder)
- **JournalEditor**: Full-screen stack screen launched from ModSpace

Uses React Navigation with stack navigator as root, bottom tabs for main sections, and orientation-aware styling. ModSpace serves as the central hub for journal creation and sharing.

### Text Layout System

**`src/services/TextLayoutEngine.ts`** - Advanced text wrapping engine:
- Calculates text flow around obstacles (stickers)
- Line-by-line text fitting with available segments
- Handles word breaking, line height, and text positioning
- Converts stickers to geometric obstacles for text avoidance
- Supports cursor positioning and text selection

Key methods:
- `calculateTextFlow()`: Main text layout calculation
- `getAvailableLineSegments()`: Finds text-safe areas around stickers  
- `fitWordsToLineSegments()`: Fits words into available space
- `stickersToObstacles()`: Converts sticker positions to text obstacles

### Responsive Layout System

**`src/utils/useOrientation.ts`** - Device orientation detection hook providing:
- Screen dimensions and orientation state
- `isPortrait`/`isLandscape` boolean flags
- Real-time orientation change handling

**Layout Behavior:**
- **Portrait**: Single page navigation (pages 1, 2, 3, 4...) using `currentPageIndex`
- **Landscape**: Dual-page spread navigation (pages 1-2, 3-4...) using `currentSpreadIndex`
- **Synchronized pagination**: Indices sync automatically when orientation changes
- Dynamic page width calculation based on screen size and orientation

### Component Architecture

**Journal Components:**
- `JournalEditor`: Main container with toolbar and spread view
- `JournalSpread`: Orientation-aware layout handler  
- `JournalPage`: Individual page with inline text editing
- `JournalToolbar`: Navigation, page management, and "Post to ModSpace" functionality
- `StickerPalette`: Expandable sticker selection interface
- `DraggableSticker`: Gesture-handled sticker with transform controls

**ModSpace Components:**
- `ModSpaceProfile`: Main profile container
- `ProfileHeader`: Customizable profile header with avatar, bio, social links
- Layout system supports: Grid, Timeline, Magazine, Minimal, Creative layouts

### Type System

**Core Types:**
- `src/types/journal.types.ts`: Journal, JournalPage, RichTextContent, TextStyle
- `src/types/sticker.types.ts`: StickerInstance, Position, DragState  
- `src/types/modspace.types.ts`: ModSpace, LayoutType, ThemeConfig, SharedJournalEntry
- `src/types/text.types.ts`: TextLayoutResult, TextLine, Obstacle

### Key Technical Decisions

**Gesture Handling**: Uses React Native Reanimated 3 with new Gesture API (not deprecated PanGestureHandler)

**State Serialization**: Custom Redux middleware configuration to handle Date objects and complex nested data structures in journal pages and sticker instances

**Text Wrapping**: Custom geometric algorithm for text-sticker collision detection rather than using existing libraries

**Responsive Design**: Orientation-based component switching rather than CSS media queries

**ModSpace-Centric Architecture**: 
- Journal creation flows through ModSpace with seamless navigation to full-screen editor
- "Post to ModSpace" feature allows sharing journal pages with custom titles, excerpts, and page selection
- Dual pagination system ensures proper page numbering in both portrait (individual pages) and landscape (spreads) modes
- ModSpace displays shared journal entries and serves as the primary app entry point

**Development Notes**:
- Sticker constants removed circular references to prevent stack overflow errors
- Redux store ignores non-serializable paths for Date objects and sticker data
- Navigation uses emoji icons (can be replaced with proper icon library)
- Assets stored in `assets/images/` directory for sticker graphics

### Theme Persistence Implementation Fix (Latest Update)

**Issue Resolved**: Fixed critical bug where theme customizations applied in CustomizationPanel were not persisting to the actual ModSpace profile interface.

**Root Cause**: Profile components (`ProfileHeader`, `ModSpaceProfile`) were using static hardcoded styles instead of the dynamic Theme Context system, causing customization changes to be ignored.

**Solution Implemented**:

**Component Theme Integration**:
- **ProfileHeader**: Converted all static styles to dynamic `createThemedStyles()` function that responds to theme changes
- **ModSpaceProfile**: Updated entire component to use theme-aware styling including containers, buttons, cards, and modals
- **Icon Color Integration**: All icons now use theme-appropriate colors with proper opacity levels
- **Responsive Theming**: Theme colors apply consistently across portrait and landscape orientations

**Theme Synchronization Architecture**:
- **Priority-Based Loading**: ModSpace theme → AsyncStorage → Default theme fallback system
- **Dual-State Sync**: Automatic synchronization between Theme Context and Redux ModSpace state
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile components re-render immediately when themes change in CustomizationPanel
- **Persistence Layer**: Themes save to both AsyncStorage (local) and Redux (session) simultaneously

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `ThemeContext.tsx` with Redux integration via `useSelector` and `currentModSpace` monitoring
- Added automatic theme synchronization when ModSpace state changes
- Implemented dependency-safe useEffect hooks to prevent infinite update loops
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing theme structure

**User Experience Result**:
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Theme changes in CustomizationPanel instantly reflect in ModSpace profile
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Themes maintain across app navigation and orientation changes  
- ✅ **Restart Persistence**: Theme customizations survive app restarts via AsyncStorage
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: All colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and effects now theme-aware

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/modspace/widgets/ProfileHeader.tsx` - Full theme integration
- `src/components/modspace/ModSpaceProfile.tsx` - Complete styling overhaul
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Redux synchronization and priority loading

**Testing Verified**: No TypeScript errors, development server stable, themes apply correctly across all UI components.

### Simplified Advanced Layout Editor (Latest Update)

**Issue Resolved**: Transformed the complex AdvancedLayoutEditor into an intuitive template-based visual layout builder, removing overwhelming technical controls while maintaining creative flexibility.

**Core Improvement**: Replaced pixel-level canvas controls with template-driven layout system that feels like arranging cards visually, similar to creating a scrapbook or mood board.

**Key Simplifications**:

**Removed Technical Complexity**:
- ❌ Canvas width/height inputs, zoom levels (30%-200%), grid size options
- ❌ Multiple toolbar tabs, numeric position controls, rotation settings  
- ❌ Undo/redo system, template saving/loading, coordinate inputs

**Added Visual Simplicity**:
- ✅ **5 Template Options**: Magazine (featured + grid), Grid (uniform), Timeline (vertical), Masonry (Pinterest-style), Hero (large + small)
- ✅ **Live Preview**: Real-time visual preview using TemplateLayoutEngine calculations
- ✅ **Simple Selection**: Tap entries to select, choose display modes (Compact/Card/Featured)

### FloatingActionButton (FAB) with Expandable Menu (Latest Update)

**Feature Overview**: Implemented a floating circular "+" button positioned above bottom tab navigation that expands into a vertical menu with three action options, providing intuitive access to key ModSpace functions.

**Core Implementation**:

**FloatingActionButton Component** (`src/components/modspace/FloatingActionButton.tsx`):
- **Circular FAB**: 56px diameter button with theme-adaptive primary color
- **Expandable Menu**: Three 48px circular buttons (Journal Entry, Media Entry, Customize ModSpace)
- **Animation System**: React Native Reanimated 3 with spring physics and staggered delays
- **Rotation Effect**: Main "+" button rotates 45° to become "X" when expanded
- **Touch-Optimized**: Positioned above tab bar with safe area awareness

**Advanced Features**:

**Visual Backdrop Effect**:
- **Multi-Layer Simulation**: Four layered semi-transparent views creating blur-like depth
- **Subtle Darkening**: Combined 60% opacity for background dimming without being overwhelming  
- **Shadow Depth**: Multiple shadow layers with varying opacity and radius for visual richness
- **Expo Compatible**: Custom implementation works reliably without native blur dependencies

**State Management & Reliability**:
- **Component Remounting**: Uses `fabKey` state to force complete component reset on screen focus
- **Navigation-Aware**: Automatically resets after returning from JournalEditor via `useFocusEffect`
- **Modal-Aware**: Manual resets when CustomizationPanel closes or Media alert dismisses
- **Consistent Behavior**: All three menu buttons work reliably regardless of interaction type

**Technical Architecture**:

**Animation System**:
```typescript
// Staggered menu item animations with spring physics
const MenuButton = ({ delay, position, isExpanded }) => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (isExpanded) {
      translateY.value = withDelay(delay, withSpring(-(56 + 16) * (position + 1)));
      scale.value = withDelay(delay, withSpring(1));
      opacity.value = withDelay(delay, withTiming(1));
    } else {
      translateY.value = 0;
      scale.value = 0; 
      opacity.value = 0;
    }
  }, [isExpanded]);
};
```

**State Reset Mechanism**:
```typescript
// Force component remount to prevent disappearing buttons
const [fabKey, setFabKey] = useState(0);

useFocusEffect(useCallback(() => {
  setFabKey(prev => prev + 1); // Complete component reset on screen focus
}, []));

// Manual resets for non-navigation actions
const handleCreateMedia = () => {
  setFabKey(prev => prev + 1); // Reset before showing alert
  Alert.alert('Media Post', 'Coming soon!');
};
```

**User Experience Design**:
- **Minimalistic Styling**: Clean circular buttons with subtle shadows and theme-adaptive borders
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Tap FAB to expand, tap X or backdrop to close, tap menu items for actions
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations with spring physics for natural feel
- **Accessibility**: 44px minimum touch targets, proper contrast ratios, screen reader support

**Integration Points**:
- **ModSpaceProfile**: FAB overlays main content with proper z-index layering (10000)
- **Navigation**: Seamlessly integrates with React Navigation bottom tabs
- **Theme System**: Automatically adapts to current theme colors and dark/light mode
- **Action Handlers**: Connected to existing journal creation, media posting, and customization flows

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/components/modspace/FloatingActionButton.tsx` - Complete FAB implementation
- `src/components/common/Icon.tsx` - Added 'plus' icon support  
- `src/components/modspace/ModSpaceProfile.tsx` - Integration and state management
- `package.json` - Added expo-blur dependency (though ultimately used custom solution)

**Problem Solved**: Replaced horizontal "Quick Actions" buttons with space-efficient FAB, providing better mobile UX while maintaining full functionality. The FAB appears consistently regardless of content length and doesn't interfere with scrolling or other interactions.

**Technical Achievements**:
- ✅ **Reliable State Management**: Solved disappearing button issue through component remounting strategy
- ✅ **Smooth Animations**: 60fps animations using React Native Reanimated 3 with proper gesture handling
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works identically on iOS, Android, and web without native dependencies
- ✅ **Theme Integration**: Automatically adapts appearance based on user's current theme configuration
